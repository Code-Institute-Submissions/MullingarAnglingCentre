# Mullingar Angling Centre

This project is a basic website to should the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript. It also includes Responsive Design and Image Treatments.

## Color Pallette

The color palette is based on the image natural-palettes.png stored in the images folder.
The idea was to take colors from an image of a river with a cloudy sky and green natural environment around the river.
This coincides with the natural surroundings when fishing and is are of the aim of this website.
