                                <p>The chub is a thick set fish with a large blunt head. It has a long and cylindrical body with large greenish/brown scales that have a slight black edging across the back working down to a lighter golden flank and a light belly with a dark brown or black tail. The dorsal fin of the chub is a greyish/green colour, with all the other fins being orange/red.Small chub often swim in shoals and as they grow the larger specimens usually become solitary. An average size chub is 2½ - 3lb. Natural food for chub include; invertebrates, crustaceans, insects, flies, mayfly, caddis fly, larvae, worms, fish fry, berries from overhanging bushes i.e. elderberry. Larger chub will eat smaller fish such as minnows, roach and dace. Chub are known for being gluttonous and will eat just about anything. 
                                <h3>The Chub Invasion</h3>
                                <p>The Chub is not native to Ireland and has only in recent years appeared in the Inny River. They are been removed from the water due to their gluttonous nature as the authorities believe they will overcome the existing fish species.</p>
                                <h3>Best Times To Fish</h3>
                                <p>Unlike other fish the chub will feed throughout the year be it a hot summer afternoon or freezing winter morning.</p>

                                <p>Pikes have the elongated, torpedo-like form of predatory fishes, with sharply pointed heads and sharp teeth. Their coloration is typically grey-green with a mottled or spotted appearance with stripes along their backs, providing camouflage among weeds. Individual pike marking patterns are unique, like fingerprints</p>
                                <p>Pike (Esox lucius) are the largest of the freshwater predators and are abundant in all Irish watercourses from small to large loughs as well as rivers and canals. Irish pike grow quickly and can reach up to 20 Kg. (over 40 lbs.) on some Irish waters with fish of 10 Kg. (over 20 lbs.) being quite common in many of our lakes and rivers.</p>
                                <p>Pike are opportunistic feeders and prey on small fodder fish such as roach, rudd, eels and hybrids. Its physical make up - the long enamelled green mottled body, the great head with its huge eyes and large mouth armed with a fearsome array of teeth makes the pike an efficient hunter. The sporting qualities and hard fighting nature of the wild Irish pike are some of the reasons that this fish is so sought after by sport anglers.</p>

                                <p>Brown trout thrive in most waters and as such are found well spread over most of Ireland. In many areas fisheries are specifically managed for them; however they are also found in waters containing large stocks of pike and coarse fish. Irish trout come in a variety of forms; Sonaghan, Gilaroo, Harvester, Croneen, Dollaghan, Ferox even Slob and Sea trout.</p>
                                <p>Gilaroo favour loughs and rivers with a good and healthy population of freshwater snails and shrimps such as Lough Mask and Corrib.</p>
                                <p>Harvester, Croneen and Dollaghan are large trout that run from some of our large loughs up tributary rivers and streams from July onward. These fish grow to an enormous size with Dollaghan of 15lbs plus not unheard of. Harvester trout generally associated with Lough Erne, Croneen with Lough Derg and Dollaghan with Lough Neagh. They can all be seen as the same type of inland sea trout.</p>
                                <p>Ferrox are to be found in some of the larger loughs feeding on char and other fish. Loughs Melvin, Corrib, Ree and Derg are well known for these large predators and are often taken by pike anglers as a by-catch.</p>

In many areas fisheries are specifically managed for them; however they are also found in waters containing large stocks of pike and coarse fish. Irish trout come in a variety of forms; Sonaghan, Gilaroo, Harvester, Croneen, Dollaghan, Ferox even Slob and Sea trout. <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#btroutModal"> Read more</a></p>

                                <p>Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are also found in Ireland, the majority restricted to small ‘put and take’ lakes. Native to North America they were not stocked in Ireland until 1899. They are fast growing; in Lough Acalla for example they have been recorded growing from 4oz to 4lbs in just two years. They are short lived, living for 3 or 4 years although triploids (sterile females) can live for 7 to 10 years.</p>
